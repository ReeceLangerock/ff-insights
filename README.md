This project was meant to generate automated insights for ESPN Fantasy football leagues, imitating the feature that Yahoo! provides for it's fantasy football leagues. It is largely completed, but without much testing, documentation or cleanup. It needs automation of a number of the backend aspects to make it useful. 

But, development is currently on hold.
